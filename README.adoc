== About rnrt

*Rnrt* stands for _Rational nth root_.
It is an experimental program used to compute a rational approximation to the nth root of any rational number.

The algorithm is simply based on a search in the Stern-Brocot tree and is currently written in Haskell.
Implementations in other programming languages may come later.

== Example usage

To get a rational approximation to the cubic root of 2 with an error less than 1/1000:

----
$ runhaskell Main.hs 3 2%1 1%1000
Closest rational number: 63 % 50
Decimal approximation: 1.26
Control: 2.000376
----

Note that the error is measured beetween the original number and the computed solution raised to the nth power.
In the above example, the error is (2.000376 - 2.0) = 0.000376, which is less than 1/1000.
